  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   We are uncovering better ways of developing
   software by doing it and helping others do it.
   Through this work we have come to value:

   *Individuals and interactions* over processes and tools
   *Working software* over comprehensive documentation
   *Customer collaboration* over contract negotiation
   *Responding to change* over following a plan

   That is, while there is value in the items on
   the right, we value the items on the left more.
